## Purpose

Channels allow you to categorize tasks, events, and [objectives](/docs/weekly-objectives)
 so that you can better understand where you are spending your time each day. The ritual flows will show you a breakdown of how you spent your time by channel.

Contexts allow you to group several channels together so that you can quickly focus your on one _context_ at a time. For example, you can switch to your "#work" context to see all just your work tasks, or you can switch to your "#personal" channel to see all your personal tasks for the day.

  

## Walkthrough

## How to use

### Filtering your workspace by channel · 0:19

Click the "Filter" button at the top of your workspace, or use keyboard shortcut `Shift F`, to reveal a dropdown menu of your contexts and channels.

Click, type, or use arrow keys to select a channel or context. This will filter your view of your workspace to only show tasks assigned to that channel or context. When you add a task while filtering, the task will get assigned to the channel you're filtering by.

> ## 👍Filter to focus
> 
> Filter your workspace view to your #work tasks during your work day so you aren't distracted by #personal tasks, and vice versa!

### Assigning a channel to a task · 1:23

While typing a new task, hit `#` while in the add task modal to assign a task, or click on the channel field.

> ## 📘AI: Channel recommendations
> 
> Use this setting in Settings > AI to have Sunsama automatically assign a suggested channel to your new tasks, so you avoid having #unassigned tasks.

If the task is already created, you can change the channel of the task by clicking on the name of the channel (or using keyboard shortcut `Q`), and selecting a different channel.

## Settings · 4:13

Access your Context and Channel settings via the main dropdown menu, or by clicking "Manage channels" in the filter channel dropdown.

Click on a particular context or channel to configure its settings, or the "Create" buttons to create new ones.

Toggle on/off the "Enable" switch next to a channel to hide or show it in your workspace.

### Personal setting

Toggle the "Personal" setting to make a context for personal tasks. Tasks assigned to a personal context or a channel within that context [do not count towards your workload in Sunsama](/docs/planned-and-actual-times#workload-counter-in-daily-columns)
. In a collaborative workspace, they will also be necessarily private.

### Private setting

Only for those in collaborative workspaces, use the Private setting to make a context or channel private to only yourself or certain members in the workspace

### Default channel

Enable this setting if you want all new tasks to be assigned to this channel by default.

Note: Enabling this means the AI: Channel recommendation feature cannot be used.

Note: Channel filtering and other automations will override your default channel setting.

### Integration links

You can link a channel with a particular Slack channel (for notifications of new and completed tasks), Asana project, or Trello board.

### Calendar <> Channel link · 7:40

From your Calendar settings, link a calendar to a channel. This will have two effects:

When you timebox a task, the resulting working session will be created on the calendar linked to that channel.

When you import an event/meeting from a calendar, the resulting task will be assigned to that linked channel.

> ## 👍Link work to work, personal to personal
> 
> Use this channel <> calendar linking so that your work tasks end up on the calendar you intend (so your colleagues [do or don't see your working sessions](/docs/timeboxing-choosing-your-calendar#how-to-not-clutter-your-calendar-with-working-sessions-%C2%B7-415)
> , per your preference), and so your personal tasks stay on your personal calendar

  

## Best Practices

*   Use the `Shift F` shortcut to filter your workspace to a specific channel or context regardless of what view you're in (e.g. Home, Daily planning, etc).
*   Don't create too many channels per context. 5-7 channels is usually a good amount. It's easy to get obsessed with finding the perfect taxonomy and organization of your data but it won't actually help you work with calm and focus.
*   Channels help you understand where you are spending your time and that's why their best kept fairly high-level e.g. just use #hiring instead of #phone-screens #interviews #debriefs.
*   If you are using Sunsama collaboratively, consider setting your default channel to a context or channel that is private or personal so that your tasks are hidden by default.
*   Make sure to designate your personal context as personal in the context's settings even if you are in a private workspace. This is useful for having personal tasks not count towards your [workload](/docs/planned-and-actual-times#workload-counter-in-daily-columns)
