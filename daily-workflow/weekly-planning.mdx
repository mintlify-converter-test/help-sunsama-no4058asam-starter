## Purpose

The weekly planning ritual guides you through planning your [objectives](/docs/weekly-objectives)
 for the week ahead.

## Walkthrough

## How to use

### Starting the weekly planning ritual Â· 0:07

By default, you'll be prompted to plan your week on Monday morning via an in-app notification. You can pick a different day and time from your [account settings](/docs/user-settings#when-do-you-plan-your-week)
 page.

Clicking on this prompt will send you into the weekly planning flow which consists of two steps:

### Step 1: Setting your objectives Â· 0:41

In the first step, you'll see a reminder of the [objectives](/docs/weekly-objectives)
 you worked on the previous week. If there's an objective from the prior week you want to keep working on, you can drag it to the next week to extend it. You can also add fresh new objectives here.

If you didn't set any objectives for the prior week, you'll only see the upcoming week's objectives.

### Step: 2: Journal Â· 2:06

Sunsama gives you the opportunity to write a small reflection on your upcoming week. You can keep it short and sweet and just list your objectives, or you can think critically about how you're feeling and what you should keep in mind to set the right expectations for yourself.

### Accessing weekly planning on demand

If you want to trigger the weekly planning ritual on demand, you can do so from the main navigation menu (click "Sunsama" in the top left corner of the app) or from the [command palette](/docs/command-palette)
.

> ## ðŸ“˜Reviewing past weekly plans
> 
> If you want to see your plan from a past week, scroll back in your Kanban to the week in question and click on the "Weekly planning" task. You will find the plan and notes embedded in the notes section of the task.

### Settings

*   If you like to reflect on the previous week and plan the upcoming week all in one sitting, you can combine the weekly review ritual and the weekly planning ritual from your [account settings](/docs/user-settings#combine-weekly-review-and-weekly-planning)
    .
*   You can make Sunday the day your week starts from your [account settings](/docs/user-settings#start-of-week)
    .

## Best practices

*   The weekly planning ritual centers around defining your weekly objectives. It's about quality here, not quantity.
*   Leave filling in the individual tasks you want to work on each day for the [daily planning ritual](/docs/daily-planning)
    . It's best not to try and plan in detail too far in advance.
*   If you work on a team that shares weekly updates, you can click "Post to Slack" to share that directly to Slack. This is a great async alternative to weekly standups.

## FAQ

### How can I post my weekly plan to Slack again?

You are able to post your weekly objectives to Slack until the start of the next weekly planning period or until you post them once. Weekly planning periods are:

*   Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday: planning for next week
*   Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday: planning for this week

Good news is, you can still access your objectives for this week and post them to Slack manually. To do so, scroll back to the day you completed your weekly planning (Monday), and open the task card titled "Weekly planning". The notes in that task are the same that get generated during the "Post to Slack" step of the weekly planning flow. You can just copy+paste those into Slack.
