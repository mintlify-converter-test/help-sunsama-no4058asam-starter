The right hand panel supports a variety of integrations and features. You can follow the links below to learn about each of those.

## Best practices

*   If you are seeing the wrong day in the right hand panel or the wrong week's objectives, check your mini-map.
*   If you timebox your tasks, we recommend [increasing the zoom level](/docs/timeboxing-faqs-and-pro-tips#zooming-into-your-calendar)
     of your calendar from the right hand panel.
*   Use the [Command Palette](/docs/command-palette)
     or [Keyboard Shortcuts](/docs/keyboard-shortcuts)
     to navigate your workspace view faster.
