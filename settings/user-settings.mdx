### General

#### Time zone

The timezone for your account. This is used across all devices.

#### Time zone alert

Show an alert when your timezone has changed. We recommend keeping this turned on.

#### Time format

How should times be displayed in Sunsama? You can chose to match the region of the device you're using, or manually set your time format to 24 hour format, or 12 hour AM/PM format. You will need to refresh Sunsama to reflect changes to this setting.

#### Start of week

Adjust your display of calendar based layouts to start weeks on Sunday or Monday.

#### Count planned time as actual time

Determines if your "planned" time on each task should be used as the "actual" time when there is no "actual" time value present.

#### Task rollover position

Determine if you'd like incomplete tasks to roll to the top of the next day's column or to the bottom.

If your rolled over tasks are usually unimportant stragglers - select "bottom". If your rolled over tasks are usually important things you didn't get to - select "top".

When tasks are sorted chronologically, all unscheduled tasks will be moved to the top or bottom based on this setting as well.

#### Workload threshold

Configure your desired workload for each day. When your daily workload gets close or exceeds this number of hours, you'll see your workload threshold change color and Sunsama will warn you that you are overcommitted.

Select "Custom by day" if you want to configure a different threshold for each day of the week.

The workload threshold only counts tasks that are in your "work" contexts. Anything in a personal [context](/docs/channels-and-contexts)
 won't count against it.

#### Calendar event color

Determine how calendar events should be colored in the calendar view.

*   **Color by channel:** to show the event in the color of it's associated channel or context or in the color of it's associated calendar if no channel is set.
*   **Color by calendar:** to show the event in it's associated calendar color regardless of whether it's in a channel or not.

#### Hide completed tasks in task list

Toggle this setting on and completed tasks will disappear from view in today's task list instead of being shown under your incomplete tasks.

Notes:

*   This setting only hides completed tasks in today's list. All completed tasks on previous days will always show.
*   You can reveal completed tasks by clicking the "N tasks completed" text at the bottom of your task list. This will show your completed tasks in today's list until you click "Showing completed tasks" or you refresh Sunsama.

#### Hide completed tasks in calendar

Toggle this setting to hide the green checkboxes that appear in the calendar view at the time a task was checked off.

#### Support chat bubble

Toggle the Intercom support bubble in the bottom left corner of the app.

If you turn this off, you can always reach us at [support@sunsama.com.](mailto:support@sunsama.com.)

#### Dark mode

Show the app in dark mode. Select "System" to force Sunsama to always match your OS/Browser's Dark/Light setting.

### Rituals

#### When do you plan you day

Select the time that your daily planning ritual will automatically appear. Times after 3 PM will cause your planning ritual to plan the [next day](/docs/evening-daily-planning)
 and times before 3 PM will plan the current day.

This also determines the time at which your daily planning reminders appear.

#### Automated daily planning

Determines if the daily planning ritual appears automatically on your screen once a day.

If you turn it off, you can always initialize the daily planning flow via the [keyboard shortcut](/docs/keyboard-shortcuts)
 `P`.

#### Automatically rollover tasks during evening planning

Note: you will only see this setting if you are an [evening daily planner](/docs/evening-daily-planning)
.

Toggle this setting on to automatically rollover incomplete tasks to tomorrow during evening daily planning (planning for tomorrow)

Toggle this setting off to not automatically rollover incomplete tasks during evening planning, and instead show a prompt to optionally select any tasks you wish to automatically rollover to tomorrow.

#### When do you end your day

Determines your suggested daily shutdown time during daily planning.

#### Automated daily shutdown

Determines if the daily shutdown ritual appears automatically each day.

If you turn this setting off, you can always access the [daily shutdown](/docs/daily-shutdown)
 via it's keyboard shortcut.

#### When do you plan your week

Select when you want to plan for the week ahead.

#### Automated Weekly Planning

Determines if you should be prompted to plan your week at the time selected.

If you turn this setting off, you can always access the weekly planning flow from the main dropdown menu.

#### Combine weekly review and weekly planning

Turn on this setting to combine your weekly review and weekly planning into one flow. If you turn this toggle on, you will not see the next two settings for weekly review, as it will be included in your weekly planning.

#### When do you review your week

Select when you want to review the most recent week.

#### Automated weekly review

Determines if you should be prompted to review each week at the scheduled time

If you turn this setting off, you can always access the weekly review flow from the main dropdown menu.

#### Include weekends during reviews

In daily planning/reflection this determines if you will see the last day or the last work day when reviewing what happened. In weekly reflection this determines if data from weekends should be shown at all.

#### Default channel for rituals tasks

Set a specific channel to automatically assign to all ritual tasks (e.g. Daily Planning, Daily Shutdown, Weekly Planning, Weekly Review). This setting will also honor any relevant calendar connections. If nothing is set, ritual tasks will be assigned to your default channel if you have one.

### Timeboxing

#### Pick which calendars tasks are scheduled to

Clicking the "Calendar Settings" button will bring you to your [calendars](/docs/integrations-settings#calendar-settings)
, where you can set up where your working sessions are created.

#### Calendar reminders for timeboxed tasks

With this setting, you can manually override the reminders/notifications settings of the underlying calendar your tasks are timeboxed to. This is useful if you want to disable reminders for Sunsama tasks on a calendar in which you have reminders turned on.

#### Calendar availability for timeboxed tasks

Set the default "availability" when creating calendar events from an existing task i.e when timeboxing.

*   **Show as busy:** If you want time spent working on tasks to show as "busy" to other people who have access to your calendar or to tools that look at your calendar to calculate your availability.
*   **Show as available:** If you want tasks to show up on your calendar but not change your underlying calendar's understanding of your availability.

#### Calendar privacy of timeboxed tasks

Sets the default privacy of calendar events that are created from an existing task i.e. when timeboxing.

*   **Calendar default:** This will honor whatever setting your underlying calendar uses when new events are created by default.
*   **Private:** All timeboxed events will be marked as private upon creation. This is a good option if you don't want colleague, who have access to your calendar, to see what you are working on.
*   **Public:** All timeboxed events will be marked as public. This is a good option if you want colleagues to always see what tasks you are working on.

> ## 📘
> 
> Tasks assigned to private channels or personal contexts will always be added to the calendar as "Private" events for your privacy.

#### Auto-scheduling gap

Pick how much time the auto-scheduler should leave between the last item on your calendar and the task being scheduled. This is a great way to give yourself some breathing room between tasks.

#### Default duration when scheduling tasks

Determines the default size of a timeboxed event if one isn't specified by the "planned time" of the task.

#### Auto-reschedule tasks when they conflict

When a task is scheduled at the same as another task(s), [automatically](/docs/auto-rescheduling)
 shift the other task(s) to the next available time.

> ## 📘Auto-reschedule tip:
> 
> Hold `Shift` when scheduling to temporarily disable this behavior

#### Auto-reschedule when a task is completed ahead of schedule

When a timeboxed task is completed ahead of schedule, [automatically](/docs/auto-rescheduling)
 adjust its scheduled end date and shift remaining tasks forward.

”. These hours will be overridden by any channel-specific schedules.

#### Auto-complete imported calendar events:

This setting asks you if a task created from a calendar event should be automatically completed in Sunsama at the scheduled end time of the event. This setting is useful for automatically completing meetings in your task list when the meeting concludes. If you also create tasks from non-meeting events and only wish to auto-complete your meetings, the option “Only if the event has invitees” is a good choice.

### AI

#### Channel recommendations

With this feature turned on, Sunsama analyzes the history of your tasks and will suggest a [channel](/docs/channels-and-contexts)
 to assign to newly created #unassigned tasks. By default, when this feature is turned on, Sunsama will "Auto-apply" the suggested channels.

![](https://files.readme.io/e836a44-Screenshot_2024-06-05_at_2.25.18_PM.png)  

> ## 📘
> 
> Note: This feature is overridden by automatic channel assignment and only works for tasks that are #unassigned to a channel upon creation. This means if you have a default channel for newly created tasks, are filtering to view any specific channel or context when creating a task, or a channel is assigned to a new task via automations, no channel recommendation will be made.
