## Calendar Settings

### Walkthrough

## How to use

### Disabling a calendar · 0:35

For calendars you don't care about, you can disable them. Disabled calendars won't be visible to you within the app.

### Setting a default task calendar · 1:00

When timeboxing your tasks, if you don't want your tasks to be scheduled to your primary calendar by default, you can choose a different calendar to be the default.

This is a good option if you don't want your tasks to clutter up your primary calendar.

### Linking a calendar to a channel · 1:26

Each of your calendars can be linked to a specific channel. So you can link your @company.com work calendar to your #work context, and you can link your @gmail.com personal calendar to your #personal context.

Once you've linked a calendar to a channel/context, when you schedule a task in that channel/context to your calendar, it will automatically be scheduled to the linked calendar.

Also, when you import an event from a calendar linked to a channel, the task that's created will automatically be assigned to the linked channel.

### Import events · 2:57

When planning your day, if there are specific calendars you regularly want to import events from, you can mark these calendars as import calendars. They'll then be considered during the [Daily Planning](/docs/daily-planning-add)
 flow for [importing meetings](/docs/importing-meetings)
.

You can also configure this and other settings for importing meetings via the [Customize Import Rules](/docs/importing-meetings#customizing-import-rules)
 settings during Daily Planning.

You can also configure Sunsama to automatically import your calendar events to your task list using Auto-sync. Refer to [this guide on how to do that](/docs/importing-meetings#importing-events-automatically)
.

## Email

### Custom email client

If you use Superhuman as your email client for your Gmail or Outlook, you can configure this setting so that opening the deep links of your Gmail or Outlook emails open that email in Superhuman instead.

### Email forwarding

Find your email forwarding addresses by going to the Email page of your Integrations. You'll find the email forwarding information at the bottom of that page.
